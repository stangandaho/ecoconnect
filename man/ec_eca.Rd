\title{Calculate Equivalent Connected Area (ECA)}
\usage{
ec_eca(pa, max_prob_matrix, with_transboundary = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pa}{sf object containing protected areas with a 'type' column distinguishing
between "ecoregion" and "transboundary" areas}

\item{max_prob_matrix}{Numeric matrix of maximum product probabilities between all
protected areas}

\item{with_transboundary}{Logical. If TRUE, includes transboundary areas in the
calculation (with area = 0 to avoid double-counting coverage). If FALSE, considers
only areas within the ecoregion. Default is TRUE}
}
\value{
Numeric value representing the ECA in square kilometers
}
\description{
This function calculates the Equivalent Connected Area (ECA) metric, which represents
the size (area) that a single protected area would need to have to provide the same
amount of reachable protected land as the current network of protected areas.
}
\details{
The ECA metric is calculated as:
\deqn{ECA = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_i \times a_j \times p_{ij}^*}}{%
ECA = sqrt(sum_i sum_j (a_i * a_j * p_ij*))}

where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{a_i} and \eqn{a_j} are the areas of protected areas i and j
\item \eqn{p_{ij}^*} is the maximum probability of connection between areas i and j
\item For transboundary areas, \eqn{a_i} = 0 to avoid counting area outside the ecoregion
}

ECA provides an intuitive measure of connectivity that can be directly compared to
the total protected area coverage. Higher ECA values indicate better connectivity
within the protected area network.

library(dplyr)
# Benin - treated as single ecoregion

# Add transboundary PAs with default 70km buffer

# Calculate edge-to-edge distances
dist_matrix <- ec_pa_distances(complete_pa, method = "edge")

# For a more mobile species (30km median dispersal)
prob_matrix <- ec_dispersal_probability(dist_matrix, median_dispersal = 30)

# Limit to maximum 3 stepping stones
max_prob <- ec_max_product_probability(prob_matrix, max_steps = 3)

# Calculate ECA including transboundary effects
