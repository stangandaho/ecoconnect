\title{Calculate Maximum Product Probability Considering Stepping-Stone Paths}
\usage{
ec_max_product_probability(prob_matrix, max_steps = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{prob_matrix}{Numeric matrix of direct dispersal probabilities between protected areas,
typically generated by \code{\link[=ec_dispersal_probability]{ec_dispersal_probability()}}}

\item{max_steps}{Integer or NULL. Maximum number of stepping stones to consider in path
calculations. If NULL, considers all possible indirect paths (up to n-1 steps where n
is the number of protected areas). Default is NULL}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of maximum product probabilities where element represents
the highest probability of reaching protected area j from protected area i, considering
all possible direct and indirect paths. Values range from 0 to 1, with 1 on the diagonal
}
\description{
This function calculates the maximum probability of reaching each destination protected area
considering both direct dispersal and indirect paths through intermediate protected areas
acting as "stepping stones". This accounts for the fact that species may reach distant
areas by making multiple shorter hops rather than one long-distance movement.
}
\details{
The function uses a dynamic programming approach similar to the Floyd-Warshall algorithm
to find optimal paths. For any two-step path i -> k -> j, the probability is calculated as:
\deqn{p_{i \to k \to j} = p_{ik} \times p_{kj}}

The algorithm iteratively considers longer paths and retains the maximum probability
found for each origin-destination pair. This approach ensures that:
\itemize{
\item Direct movements are considered when they provide the highest probability
\item Indirect movements through stepping stones are considered when they provide
higher probability than direct movement
\item The optimal path (highest probability) is selected for each pair of areas
}

Stepping-stone connectivity is particularly important for species with limited dispersal
ability, as it allows them to reach distant suitable habitat through a series of
shorter movements.

library(dplyr)
# Benin - treated as single ecoregion

# For a more mobile species (30km median dispersal)
prob_matrix <- ec_dispersal_probability(dist_matrix, median_dispersal = 30)

# Limit to maximum 3 stepping stones
